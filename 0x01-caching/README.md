# 0x01. Caching

## 📚 Description

This project is part of the **ALX Software Engineering - Interview Preparation** curriculum. It introduces the concept of **caching** and explores various cache replacement policies by implementing different cache systems from scratch using Python.

You’ll build and extend caching mechanisms to understand how data can be stored temporarily to improve system performance and responsiveness — a common strategy in backend systems and web applications.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain what a cache is and why it’s used.
- Describe the different cache replacement policies (FIFO, LRU, MRU, LIFOCache).
- Implement various caching strategies using object-oriented programming in Python.
- Use inheritance to build flexible and extendable cache systems.
