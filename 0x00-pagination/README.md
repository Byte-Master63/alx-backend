# 0x00. Pagination

## 📚 Description

This project is part of the **ALX Software Engineering Interview Preparation** curriculum. It focuses on implementing **pagination**, a common backend pattern used in APIs and web applications to manage large datasets by dividing them into manageable chunks (pages).

You’ll be building a simple pagination system for a dataset stored in a CSV file using **Python**. The key is to return only the data required for a specific page and provide helpful pagination metadata.
